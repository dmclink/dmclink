- 👋 Hi, I’m @dmclink
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, trading, video games, and pixel art
- 🌱 I’m currently learning frontend development (JavaScript, HTML5/CSS, React)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building software and apps people enjoy
      - I'm a lot more comfortable working with backend tech and databases, but I won't back down from learning a new skill
- 📫 You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmclink)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to build airplanes
